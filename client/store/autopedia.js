            'Elvis’ BMW 507 lives on: Comeback at the Concours d’Elegance in Pebble Beach.',
          content: `Munich. The glittering comeback is now following one of the most spectacular classic-car discoveries of recent times. The BMW 507 was driven by US musician Elvis Presley, famous already at that time as the “King of Rock’n’Roll”, while he was doing his military service in Germany. After that it disappeared for nearly 50 years and was believed to have been lost before returning to the limelight. After almost two years of exacting restoration work, BMW Group Classic is presenting the roadster for the first time in a public arena. Restored to its original condition, it will be exhibited on 21 August 2016 at the Concours d’Elegance in Pebble Beach, California. The BMW 507 with chassis number 70079 will be on view for visitors to the popular classic car show exactly as it was when soldier Elvis Presley took delivery of the car on 20 December 1958: with paintwork finished in Feather White, the 150 hp V8 aluminium engine under the bonnet, centre-lock rims, black-and-white interior and a Becker Mexico radio.

          “The opportunity to bring back the BMW 507 owned by the King of Rock’n’Roll to us here in Munich for purposes of restoration in accordance with the wishes of the previous owner, Jack Castor, was a dream come true for all those involved,” commented Ulrich Knieps, Head of BMW Group Classic. “This was an exceptionally fascinating project. The outcome is not simply a source of great pride to us. Jack would undoubtedly have been delighted by the outcome.” In the summer of 2014, the exhibition of the unrestored discovery at the BMW Museum generated a great deal of excitement among classic car enthusiasts, but it also threw up questions: Was this really once Elvis’ BMW 507? And will it even be possible to transform this roadster back into a jewel of the 1950s?

          From “Return to Sender” into “It’s Now or Never”.

          The condition of the two-seater really was a cause for concern. Although the original body parts and other components were virtually all present and intact, the roadster had lost its engine and gearbox. The rear axle was a “replacement part” of unknown origin, rust was eating away the floor assembly, the seats were worn and there was no instrument panel. However, the fascination of a rare and beguilingly beautiful automobile outweighed all the inadequacies and deficiencies, augmented by the memory of Elvis Presley and his greatest hits. While the roadster came back to Munich under the slogan of “Return to Sender”, the solution was undoubtedly “It’s Now or Never”. A project managed by BMW Group Classic succeeded in restoring the automobile. In-house experts and external specialists joined forces to carry out the work and the result defined new benchmarks for the restoration of a BMW 507.

          Looking back on the process, the story of Elvis’ BMW 507 and its restoration is pure Rock’n’Roll: as captivating as the swinging hips of the “King”, energy sapping, an emotional roller-coaster, and full of surprising twists and turns. This is not simply a tale about the young GI Elvis Presley. It is also about the experienced “hillclimb champion” Hans Stuck, kissable lips daubed on white paint, a retired space engineer and a warehouse for pumpkins, a Chevy engine that was much too big, rubberised coconut mats and door handles printed in a 3D process. And the story already began three years before the “King” started military service with the US Army stationed in Hesse, Southern Germany.

          Myth among rarities: The BMW 507 of the “King”.

          The BMW 507 has always been one of the most exclusive and sought-after rarities in the model history of the brand with just 254 automobiles being produced between 1955 and 1959. Right after its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in 1955, the two-seater penned by designer Albrecht Graf Goertz was hailed in the press as the “Dream from the Isar”. Celebrity owners like Alain Delon, Ursula Andress and John Surtees contributed to the image of the roadster as a status symbol. However, no other automobile of this model is shrouded in mythology like the BMW 507 once owned by Elvis Presley. This particular roadster was believed to have been lost for almost five decades. In fact, there was not even certainty about the chassis number of the car driven by the “King”. There were also doubts about whether Elvis Presley had ever transported the car back to the USA after he finished his military service in Germany, and nobody knew anything about the subsequent ownership of the car.

          All these puzzles have now been solved thanks to the experts at the BMW Group Classic Archives and American journalist Jackie Jouret, who works for “Bimmer” magazine in California. In 2006, she was already searching through contemporary reports for Elvis’ BMW 507 and relevant literature going into the history of this model. During the course of her work, she uncovered an essential detail. Various sources highlighted the fact that the BMW 507 delivered to Elvis Presley in Germany was not a brand new automobile but had previously been used by racing driver Hans Stuck. Between May and August 1958, the racing driver known as the “Hillclimb Champion” won a number of hillclimbs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland – in a white BMW 507 with chassis number 70079 and registration plate M–JX 800. It is also a known fact verified by photographs that this roadster rolled off the assembly line on 13 September 1957. A few days later, it was exhibited at the Frankfurt International Motor Show and repeatedly used for test drives by the press. As early as October 1957, Hans Stuck presented the car at the London Motor Show and then drove the roadster through Belgium, where he presented it to King Baudouin, before motoring down to the Turin Motor Show. And as if that were not enough, in the summer of 1958, Stuck’s BMW 507 won the automobile beauty competition in Wiesbaden and then played a role in the Bavaria film studio for the feature film “Hula-Hopp Conny” with Cornelia Froboess and Rudolf Vogel.

          This vehicle had been carefully serviced at BMW after every race, the engine had been upgraded and a new gearbox fitted when it ended up with a dealer in Frankfurt in the autumn of 1958. The young US soldier Presley was 23 at the time, and he came along and took it out on a test drive for a spin. The “King” was immediately impressed by it and decided to buy the car. Photos taken at the time show that export licence plates had already been fitted to the BMW 507. Later on it was given a registration from the US military that changed every year. This was part of the reason why subsequent identification of the vehicle proved to be complicated later on. The experts from the BMW Group Classic Archives were only absolutely certain about its provenance when they came across the insurance proposal from December 1958 which contained the chassis number 70079 alongside registration of the keeper of the vehicle as Elvis Aaron Presley.

          Pampered in Germany, radically modified in the USA.

          Elvis Presley used the BMW 507 to drive between his home in Bad Nauheim and the US Army Base in Friedberg. His female fans always kept a close eye on him and he was often mobbed by them. The paintwork of the roadster was frequently daubed with messages of love painted in lipstick. These signs of adoration were by no means unusual for a rock star but they were an embarrassment to Presley as a young US soldier. A new livery in Red for the vehicle solved the problem.

          In March 1960, Elvis Presley ended his military service in Germany. Back on American highways, he must have abandoned sheer driving pleasure in an open-top BMW since a few months later he traded in the red roadster bearing chassis number 70079 with a Chrysler dealer in New York. The dealer in turn sold the car for the ridiculously low price from today’s perspective of 4 500 dollars to radio moderator Tommy Charles. Charles took the automobile to his home town of Birmingham in the state of Alabama where a very successful racing career began, although this move was very questionable when it came to the issue of authenticity. The BMW 507 was fitted with a Chevrolet engine in preparation for action on the race track. This took up so much space that parts of the front frame carrier had to be cut out. The gearbox and the rear axle, and the instruments in the cockpit were replaced. Charles won a race in Daytona Beach/Florida with the radically modified roadster and he lined up on the starting grid in several more competitions before selling the vehicle in the course of 1963.

          Two more changes of ownership followed and the BMW 507 then went to California. Space engineer Jack Castor acquired the car in 1968 and he used it occasionally as a runabout for everyday use before deciding to put the car into storage for a subsequent restoration. Castor was a passionate collector of historic bicycles and over the years he also amassed an impressive collection of classic automobiles in Half Moon Bay to the south of San Francisco. He got involved with several classic car clubs and delved into the history of the vehicles he had acquired.

          The “Holy Grail” in the pumpkin warehouse.

          Castor also put together a comprehensive dossier on his BMW 507. Meanwhile, the engineer had gone into retirement and one day he happened to see the article in “Bimmer” magazine. Castor wrote to the author, told her about the BMW 507 with chassis number 70079 that he owned and invited her over to look at the vehicle. He was aware that he was the owner of the racing car driven by “hillclimb champion” Hans Stuck, but up to then he had only been able to speculate about a potential connection with Elvis. However, Jackie Jouret was absolutely certain about this issue. She accompanied Jack Castor to a warehouse for pumpkins where the red BMW 507 was stored alongside other venerable vehicles. “Jack had tied down its engine bonnet with ropes,” recalled the journalist when she looked back on the moment of discovery. “It took some time until we actually got the engine compartment open and identified the stamped chassis number: 70079, the Holy Grail among BMW numbers.”

          Jack Castor had already collected a large number of parts carefully stowed in boxes for the planned restoration of the roadster to its original condition. What he lacked was an appropriate engine and the necessary time to see the project through. However, things then started to happen. Jackie Jouret set up the contact with BMW Group Classic where new information about the identity of the BMW 507 used by Elvis Presley in Germany was being gathered. This allowed the facts that had been researched in the USA to be confirmed.

          Jack Castor was not interested in making a fast buck out of the unexpected additional fame of his BMW 507. However, the contact with BMW Group Classic was strengthened. After several years and a number of discussions with the experts for restoring classic cars at BMW Group Classic, Klaus Kutscher and Axel Klinger-Köhnlein, an agreement was reached. Alongside the purchase of the vehicle by BMW Group Classic, it also included the authentic restoration of the car along the lines envisaged by Castor.

          By container to the museum – and from there into the workshop.

          The time had come in the spring of 2014. The BMW 507 was shipped to Germany in a container, together with the spare parts collected by Castor. The first stop in Munich was the BMW Museum where the roadster was presented to an admiring audience in the special exhibition “Elvis’ BMW 507 – lost and found”. Work then began on restoration in the workshop of BMW Group Classic.

          As was usual for projects of this nature, phase one was primarily destructive in nature. The vehicle was completely dismantled, a process which in this special case took an entire week, rather than the two days that had been originally planned. Initially, the aluminium body was separated from the floor assembly made of sheet steel. This was the only way of retaining as much of the original material as possible. The paint was then removed from the floor assembly in an acid bath and from the body in an alkaline bath. The engine had already been removed and the remnants of the interior that remained had been set aside.

          A lot of components had to be remanufactured from scratch because the stocks of original parts for the BMW 507 are limited even at BMW Group Classic. Traditional craftsmanship in the style of the 1950s was melded with high-tech production procedures of the modern world. The instrument panel was newly cast on the basis of the original. The leather upholstery was created to precisely match the pattern shown in old photographs and catalogues. When the seats were reconstructed, it proved possible to use the original steel subframe for the seats after all the rust had carefully been removed. A rubberised coconut mat was then drawn over the steel springs. This natural material was already being used in the 1950s for series production of the BMW 507, alongside the overlaid felt and linen layers to make the seats as comfortable as possible. Window winders and door handles were remanufactured in an advanced, modern 3D printing process based on the original dimensions. After producing a digital data set by three-dimensional scan of the original part, a facsimile was generated with the help of additive manufacturing and mirror finished afterwards. By contrast, the rubber seal for the tank cover was reproduced in a conventional manufacturing procedure. Since this component like many others in the BMW 507 had fallen prey to the ravages of time, a small series was produced. This means that roadster users are now able to source this spare part in the parts shop of BMW Group Classic.

          The BMW 507 makes a comeback – it’s just like the car Hans Stuck drove, the one Elvis purchased, and this is the way Jack Castor wanted it.

          The engine for Elvis’ BMW 507 was completely rebuilt from spare parts. The 3.2 litre V8 engine was reconditioned precisely in conformity with the original specifications of the BMW 507, but it was not given an engine number on account of the unavoidable but otherwise unusual use of old and new components. The front frame carrier, which had been cut down at an early stage, also had to be reproduced in its original geometry and integrated in the floor assembly. The wooden nailing strip for fixing the soft top in place was also reproduced using materials and processing methods in keeping with the 1950s.

          Maximum authenticity was also the objective in painting the vehicle. The BMW 507 is now resplendent once again in Feather White. The primer coat, the filler and the top coat were not applied by the methods that are commonplace today. Rather, they were implemented in a procedure that corresponds to the technology in use some 60 years ago. This enabled the excessive colour brilliance to be avoided which is considered desirable nowadays but is inappropriate for classic cars.

          Similar to the reconstruction of the V8 engine and the use of true-to-original parts and production procedures, the selection of paintwork also corresponds precisely to the conditions defined by Jack Castor. Right from the start, he wanted to restore the roadster to the original condition it was supplied in back in 1958. However, his aspiration to be able to see the BMW 507 through the eyes of the “King” remained unfulfilled. Jack Castor passed away at the age of 77 in November 2014. We will therefore remember him at Pebble Beach. The BMW 507 will be presented there for the first time not simply as the automobile of the “King”, but also as the legacy of Jack Castor and a masterpiece of BMW Group Classic.`,

            'Why John Surtees’ 1957 BMW 507 Roadster is the perfect addition to any garage',
          content: `Looking for a new set of wheels? Then consider this vintage BMW. Its USP? It was once owned by the late John Surtees, and it’ll go on sale for the first time at this year’s Festival of Speed.

            The one-owner 1957 BMW 507 Roadster currently has a pre-sale guide between £2m – £2.2m and comes directly from the estate of the former F1 and Grand Prix motorcycle legend. When he acquired the car in 1957, Surtees was the reigning 500cc Motorcycle World Champion, and, according to auction house Bonhams, fell in love with the model when he spotted then-BMW engineering director Alexander von Falkenhausen driving one at Hockenheim. “He saw me looking at it, and said to try it,’’ Surtees recalled. “I came back thinking ‘that’s rather nice’.’’

            The car was eventually gifted to Surtees by Count Domenico Agusta as a reward for his World Championship success (Surtees was riding for the Count’s factory team, MV Agusta), but because it warranted a high price tag of £3,000, both men decided to go halves on it. Surtees drove the elegant beauty throughout Europe, but early on in his ownership he contacted BMW to complain that his model wasn’t as powerful as the one he test-drove, nor did it have the same braking ability.

            Why John Surtees&#8217; 1957 BMW 507 Roadster is the perfect addition to any garage
            As a result, BMW carried out the required modifications and “breathed upon” his car’s V8 engine, enhancing its power and torque, and also invited him to carry out brake testing in Birmingham with Dunlop, who fitted his car with four-wheel disc brakes.
            Surtees kept the car until he passed away in 2017, and now this 507 – complete with rare factory hardtop – will be offered at public auction in July. For all the petrolheads out there, this is an essential.`,

          content: `Since it was discovered in a dusty San Francisco garage two years ago, the decrepit BMW 507 Roadster that was once so famously owned by Elvis Presley has undergone a scrupulous restoration at BMW’s Classic division in Munich. But should it have been left as it was found?
          Journalist Jackie Jouret tracked down the car after noticing a discrepancy with the serial number of the other BMW 507 that was previously believed to have been owned by ‘The King’. She realised that chassis 70079, which was soon discovered to be nestled away in Jack Castor’s barn, was indeed the real Elvis 507.

          Over the years, the thought-lost car had fallen into a state of disrepair, and who better to undertake the restoration of such a significant 507 than BMW’s Classic division? Over a two-year period, it embarked on a meticulous ground-up restoration, which involved returning the red roadster to ‘Featherwhite’, as it was originally delivered, and building an entirely new engine to replace the Chevrolet V8 that had been subsequently fitted. The whole process has been documented on BMW Classic’s website, and the finished car is set to make its debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance alongside a number of other BMWs, to celebrate the marque’s centenary. Looking at the beguiling originality of the car in the ‘before’ pictures, we wonder if a more sympathetic restoration would have been more appropriate? We certainly would have kept it in red – Elvis had sprayed it that colour allegedly to hide the lipstick-drawn notes he’d receive every time he left it somewhere. Some might say he had a Wooden Heart?`,

          title: `How The Curvaceous Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Gave Rise To The Wedges Of The 1970s`,
          content: `Glance at the Tipo 33 Stradale below. Now the white and orange Cuneo in the group above. Pretty stark contrast right? Franco Scaglione’s Stradale is beautifully bulbous—arguably the zenith of contoured ’60s design—while the word Cuneo literally translates to “wedge.” Yet only a few years separate the two cars, and the doorstop profile of Gandini’s 33-based Carabo came only a year after the Stradale was shown to the public in 1967.<br><br>
          The point is, very few, if any, can rival the scope of influence the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 had on automotive aesthetics. Not only did the chassis evolve into a dominant force in motorsport (that’s a different story, told in summary here), but the bodywork laid over the mid-engined V8’s tube-frame by the great Italian design houses helped bring about a sea change of car design. It was an apex, a fulcrum, a turning point. Whatever you want to call it, no other chassis can claim the scope that the 33 can in this regard; the early in-house designs from Milan are still regarded as some of the blurriest lines between function and sculpture, while the unabashedly angular coach-built concepts that followed set the groundwork for the first true generation of supercars. It perfected the sensuous flowing forms that came to prominence in the 1950s, while also setting the stage for the ankle-slicing era of the Countach. Seeing as we already covered the racing history of the 33 last week, let’s take a look now at four of the concept cars built on its underpinnings.<br><br>
          <span>1968: Carabo, designed by Marcello Gandini/Bertone</span><br><br>
          Speaking of the Countach, Marcello Gandini is also credited with the most well-known of the re-bodied Tipo 33s: the Carabo. Named after a beetle and debuting at the 1968 Paris Motor Show, the car was a wide departure from the muscular radii of the Stradale it was based on, and it cast off the zeitgeist by creating a new one—Gandini, working at Bertone at the time, was simply ahead of his time with this concept.<br><br>
          For instance: the use of the contrasting black and grey composites integrated with the traditionally painted panels, a liberal application of louvers, the hidden headlights, the flat planes that make up the cockpit, the way it eschewed round fenders for low box-cuts in the rear, the buttressed inlet behind the door (look at LaFerrari and so many of the other cutting-edge hypercars in profile to see what I mean), the list continues. The rear end alone contains heaps of instruction for the styling movements that came on the heels of this car. The grid-like taillights predate the ’80s love affair with them by more than a decade, and if you squint just a little bit, you might notice a touch of silhouette race car in the way the transom is encased by the quarter panels and that pert, sharp wedge of a wing.<br><br>
          <span>1969: Iguana, designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro/Italdesign</span><br><br>
          A year after Gandini’s masterpiece came another precursor for the ’70s: the Iguana. And if anybody had a better portfolio back then than Gandini, it was Giugiaro. I feel a bit repetitive at this point in saying this, but like the Carabo, the Iguana was also a peek into the future. There are clear elements of Maserati Bora, Lamborghini Urraco, and even a bit of Espada if you stretch it just a tad, but what’s most interesting in terms of tipping the ’60s into the ’70s is the way this bodywork reinterprets things.<br><br>
          What I mean is, though it was a decidedly “new” look, the Iguana didn’t completely cast off the curves of its predecessors, and it wasn’t an anachronistic mess either—it kept some elements of the past but presented them anew. The best example of this can be seen in the front end, where the pontoon fenders embraced by cars like the 911 was totally reimagined and rebuilt with ruler-straight lines. The layout is still there, but it’s achieved through a wide, hard-cut inlet that extends the length of the hood as opposed to cylindrical elements leading up to the headlights. Another and more innovative feature of the Italdesign Iguana though is the novel spoiler in the rear. Aerodynamics as a whole was sort of a nascent concept at the time, let alone an electronically controlled wing that could theoretically change the handling of the car at speed.<br><br>
          <span>1969: 33/2 Coupe Speciale, designed by Leonardo Fioravanti/Pininfarina</span><br><br>
          This car is the most unique of the bunch for a few reasons. For one, it began life as a Ferrari, and two, I think we can view it more like an alternate timeline than a forebear for the actual, realized ’70s—it seems like a more natural progression than the severe angles of the cars shown above, retaining plenty of the svelte curves amidst the sharper cuts in its bodywork. Okay, back to the Ferrari bit. Leonardo Fioravanti originally drew this up at Pininfarina for Ferrari as a means to research the increasing importance of aerodynamics on race cars. It featured a few differences in its first iteration— most notable of which was a bank of lights set between the pronged front end—and it was originally called the 250 P5 (if you didn’t see connections to the P3/4 at first, they are probably clear now in the canopy design and that quarter panel intake). As the story goes, Enzo thought the front end looked like a pill that goes up your bottom, and the company was already at work on the car that would become the 512, so the project was given to Alfa Romeo when they asked.<br><br>
          Atop the 33 Stradale chassis, the car was further refined to become the 33/2 Coupe Speciale. Though it ditched the funky strakes on the rear end that it wore while wearing its rosso corsa paint job, it also lost the odd bar of lights on the front end for a more traditional look with the classic Alfa grille and a pair of pop-ups. As an aerodynamic study, the design was offered an alternative to the increasing popularity of wings and spoilers and dams, and the resulting shape was far prettier and more organic than its protruding contemporaries. The Speciale is a masterful blend of negative space and aggressive convexities, and to me it looks like the Mach 5 went abroad for a fine Italian suit.<br><br>
          <span>1971: 33 Spider Cuneo, designed by Paolo Martin/Pininfarina</span><br><br>
          If the Carabo was a little too severe for you, you probably won’t find the Cuneo attractive in the slightest. Indeed, it is hard to call beautiful by any traditional standards; it’s stark, it’s exceedingly simple, and it looks more like a Jetson’s background drawing than a car bodied by Pininfarina. The headlights look like an afterthought, the orange stripes seem to exist simply so it doesn’t look like a bland white slice of cheese, and the rear end looks like it was cobbled together from the blandest parts bin they could find. All that said, I love this thing. How can you not? It’s an Italian UFO with just enough room in it for you and Sofia Loren to bomb down to the autostrada listening to the velocity stacks sucking air into the mid-mounted V8.<br><br>
          This car actually began its life as a different 33-based concept car, the 33 Roadster. That car looked like a cross between this one and wakeboard boat, and the Cuneo is a purer interpretation of its design. It’s not as busy, and in its simplicity comes its striking presence. Call it minimalist, call it an 8-bit Batmobile, but there’s no denying this car’s capacity to captivate.<br><br>
          There were of course two more concepts built on the Tipo 33’s underpinnings that are not pictured here—one the aforementioned Roadster that no longer exists in that form, along with the very last of the breed, the 1976 Navajo—but the four shown here, photographed by our friend Rosario Liberti, exemplify the scope of the group in our opinion. If only we could see these shapes spinning on the floors of today’s auto shows as opposed to yet another 1,000hp full-size kid’s toy…`,

          title: `Is the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale the sexiest car of all time?`,
          content: `<em>During a recent visit to the Museo Storico Alfa Romeo, we were allowed to wheel the company’s Tipo 33 Stradale — undoubtedly one of, if not the most beautiful sports cars ever created — out into the Milanese evening sunshine for an impromptu photoshoot. Our man Rémi Dargegen captured the moment…</em><br><br>
          Arresting. Having spent considerable time scratching our heads and poring through the dictionary in search for an adjective that hasn’t been used before to describe the Alfa Tipo 33 Stradale, we think it’s a word that encapsulates the quasi-road car beautifully. The Stradale does more than simply catch your eye — it seizes your total attention and holds it ransom from reality. It causes jaws to drop, incomprehensible noises to utter hopelessly from mouths, and the odd eye to well up. But isn’t that everything a proper Alfa should do?<br><br>
          <span>Law of averages</span><br><br>
          Ask any in-the-know car enthusiast what they think are some of the most beautiful cars in the world, and we’d bet that nine out of 10 times, the Tipo 33 Stradale would crop up. Of course, its beauty is entirely subjective, but we’d defy anyone to label Franco Scaglione’s slender and sensual, yet positively powerful, design as anything other than masterful. Its diminutive proportions are judged to perfection, and the way your eyes constantly trace the contours of the Marazzi-built aluminium body is freakish. It’s pure theatre, inside and out, right down to the injectors fitted high on the tall velocity stacks, which spit flames incessantly on the raucous start up.<br><br>
          <span>Transformation</span><br><br>
          As you’ll well know, the Tipo 33 was Alfa’s go at using its racing knowledge and technology to build a car for the road. Except, as the successful Tipo 33 racer underwent its transformation from open sports prototype to closed supercar, startlingly few concessions were made in the name of practicality. Sure, the interior was strewn with leather and gone were the ground-hugging spoilers, but the lock-less steering rack was retained, side mirrors were deemed ungainly and left off, and the miniature 2.0-litre V8 — mounted amidships, just like the racer — was barely detuned.<br><br>
          <span>Details, differences</span><br><br>
          Power figures no-doubt varied from car to car, as did many of the small design details, but around 230bhp seems to be a commonly quoted figure. It might not seem like much, but when you consider that the car weighed a scant 700kg, it was certainly no slouch. The first private owner of a Stradale, American Henry Wessels II, was once quoted as saying, “…on the autostrada to Venice, I ran it for 4km at its 10,000rpm rev limit in sixth. I clocked it at 180mph.” Yes, this was still a purebred racer, all right.<br><br>
          <span>The most expensive car in the world</span><br><br>
          Furthermore, at 9.75m liras, the Tipo 33 Stradale was expensive — really expensive — and, as such, just 18 were built, five of which were used by the likes of Bertone, Pininfarina, and Italdesign as platforms for wild design studies (none of which, we hasten to add, have aged half as well as the Stradale). Fewer than 10 examples are known to remain and, as you’d expect, finding one for sale makes buying most 1960s competition Ferraris seem relatively straightforward.<br><br>
          <span>Imitation is flattery</span><br><br>
          Save for some grainy period promotional footage, a fleeting appearance in the raunchy 1960s Italian flick That Splendid November, and, more recently, a number of showings on the concours d’elegance scene, these cars just aren’t seen in public. But its elusiveness is all part of the appeal. No heart could fail to stir at the sight of a Tipo 33 Stradale, and it’s as simple as that.`,

          content: `Le 31 août 1967, les amoureux de sport automobile avaient rendez-vous à Monza, pour assister au Grand Prix d'Italie de Formule 1. Un événement choisi par Alfa Romeo pour présenter au public sa 33 Stradale, un modèle homologué pour la route et inspité de la Tipo 33/2 de compétition.<br><br>
          En cette fin d'été 2017, cette Alfa célèbre ses 50 ans et le constructeur en en profite pour lui rendre hommage  au travers d'une exposition dans son Museo Storico d'Arese. Mais, au-delà de ce bel âge, pourquoi la 33 Stradale jouit-elle d'une réputation si flatteuse ? Qu'est-ce qui a rendu cette voiture aussi exceptionnelle ?<br><br>
          <span>Une voiture produite à 18 exemplaires</span><br><br>
          Un chiffre suffit à comprendre le mythe qui s'est forgé autour de ce modèle : 18. Soit le nombre d'exemplaires produits. Son prix pour l'époque a aussi de quoi faire tourner les têtes : 10 millions de lires.<br><br>
          L'Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale a été dessinée par Franco Scaglione, souvent présenté comme "l'un des plus grands designers automobiles italiens". De fait, c'est aussi à lui que l'on doit l'Alfa Romeo-Abarth 1000 berlinetta de compétition pour Bertone en 1958, l'Apollo GT ou encore la Lamborghini 350 GTV en 1963.<br><br>
          Son caractère sportif est illustré par la présence de l'emblématique trèfle, le Quadrifoglio, sur les ailes. Pour le reste, la 33 Stradale de courbes généreuses et élancées, avec de larges optiques, typiques des années 1960. Ce design intemporel a d'ailleurs inspiré les créateurs de la récente Alfa Romeo 4C.<br><br>
          <span>Des performances à couper le souffle</span><br><br>
          Sous le capot aussi, l'Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale sait comment se faire remarquer. La belle abrite un moteur 8 cylindres de 1995cm3 d'une puissance de 230 chevaux et son châssis tubulaire en alliage léger lui permet de ne pas excéder les 700 kilos sur la balance.<br><br>
          Ces deux facteurs combinés lui font atteindre pas moins de 260km/h en vitesse de pointe, pour un passage de 0 à 100km/h effectué en 5,5 secondes environ. Déjà très honnêtes en 2017, ces chiffres sont carrément impressionnants en 1967.<br><br>
          Belle, performante, rare, chère : l'Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale remplit tous les critères de la voiture d'exception. On comprend pour le constructeur en est toujours aussi fier, 50 ans après sa création.<br><br>`,
